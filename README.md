# Spotify Plus
Welcome to Spotify Plus!
My project uses spotify python api to create an interface with extra features. One major component is a music recommendation algorithm, which is be based on a user's liked music and recommends songs by similar artists to be added to a playlist. The user can automatically create playlists of different moods - happy, sad, workout, or chill music for example. Another feature is that you can add your top songs to the spotify queue.

This works directly with your spotify account, so check your app to view the new changes.
The default device to add songs to your queue is the device you are currently using.

Before running spotifyxx.py, you need to install spotipy (spotify python library) and you have to enter in your spotify credentials, including the clientID and client secret ID. You must also install python PIL using pip install.

To install spotipy, run:
pip install spotipy --upgrade
in your command prompt.

To install pillow, run:
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
in your command prompt.

After installation, you can run the file. On start, the file will open a google window. Copy and paste the url into the shell/terminal for user authorization.

Enjoy!
